  This is a very long prompt that exceeds the maximum token limit and should trigger the max length validation error. The prompt should be under 8192 tokens but this one is intentionally made to be much longer to test the validation system. We need to add more content to ensure it exceeds the token limit. Let me continue adding more text here to make sure we trigger the length validation error. This is a test prompt for the PromptOS policy engine validation system. The purpose is to test that all the validation rules are working correctly.
  
  More content to exceed length...

  Additional text to make it longer...
  The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. All good men come to the aid of their country. Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. All good men come to the aid of their country.
  
  Even more content to ensure we exceed the token limit. This is important for testing the max length validation rule which should trigger an error when the prompt exceeds 8192 tokens.
