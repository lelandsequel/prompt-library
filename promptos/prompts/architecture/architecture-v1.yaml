prompt: |
  Please help me create architecture documentation for the {{project_name}} system.

  System Overview:
  {{overview}}

  Key Components/Services:
  {{components}}

  Technology Stack:
  {{tech_stack}}

  {{#if context}}
  Additional Notes:
  {{context}}
  {{/if}}

  Please provide:
  1. High-level architecture description
  2. Component interaction diagram (text-based)
  3. Data flow explanation
  4. Key design decisions and rationale
  5. Scalability considerations
  6. Potential bottlenecks and recommendations

examples:
  - name: microservice_architecture
    inputs:
      project_name: E-commerce Platform
      overview: Multi-tenant e-commerce platform with inventory management
      components: "User Service, Product Service, Order Service, Payment Service"
      tech_stack: "Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS Lambda, Kubernetes"
    expected_output: Should include service diagram, data flow, design decisions

usage: Use to document system architecture for new projects or existing systems.

contexts:
  - New system design
  - Architecture reviews
  - Onboarding documentation

instructions:
  - Use ASCII diagrams where helpful
  - Be specific about technologies
  - Consider trade-offs in design decisions
